      <p><b>Are you an entrepreneur or engineer with innovative ideas for using technology to improve education?</b></p>

      <p>Recent international assessments ranked 15-year-olds in the U.S. 25th out of 30 countries in math performance and 21st in science performance. From 1985 to 2012, the cost of college tuition increased approximately 500%, nearly two and half times faster than inflation.</p>

      <p>This hackathon is open to innovators, developers and doers who want to build, over 2 nights, creative solutions to improve education. At the end of the Hackathon, the teams will  pitch their applications via YouTube to a panel of highly accomplished judges and the top three winners will receive $5000 in cash prizes.</p>

      <p>Teams of any size are invited to signup today. If you don't yet have a team, there is <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/virtual-hackathon-reforming-education/">an online team formation page</a>.
