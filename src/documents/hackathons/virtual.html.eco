      <p><b>Are you an entrepreneur or engineer with innovative, market-based ideas for using technology to improve education?</b></p>

      <p>Recent international assessments ranked 15-year-olds in the U.S. 25th out of 30 countries in math performance and 21st in science performance. From 1985 to 2012, the cost of college tuition increased approximately 500%, nearly two and half times faster than inflation.</p>

      <p>This moonlight hackathon is open to innovators, developers and doers who want to build, over 3 nights, creative market-based solutions to improve education. All teams will have access to awesome remote mentors, pitch their applications via YouTube to the American public and the top three will receive $5000 in cash prizes.</p>

      <p>Teams of 2-4 are invited to signup today. If you don't yet have a team, an online team meetup page will be setup prior to the event and whether you are a backend person and code in Node/Ruby/Go or are a designer and only work with Illustrator, you are invited to participate.</p>
