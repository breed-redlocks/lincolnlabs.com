      <p><b>Are you an entrepreneur or engineer with innovative, market-based ideas for using technology to improve education?</b></p>

      <p>Recent international assessments ranked 15-year-olds in the U.S. 25th out of 30 countries in math performance and 21st in science performance. From 1985 to 2012, the cost of college tuition increased approximately 500%, nearly two and half times faster than inflation.</p>

      <p>This moonlight hackathon is open to innovators, developers and doers who want to build, over 2 nights, creative market-based solutions to improve education. All teams will have access to awesome remote mentors.  At the end of the Hackathon, the teams will  pitch their applications via YouTube to the American public and the top three winners will receive $5000 in cash prizes.</p>

      <p>Teams of 2-4 are invited to signup today. If you don't yet have a team, there is <a href="https://github.com/lincolnlabs/lincolnlabs.com/wiki/Virtual-Hackathon-Team-Formation-Page">an online team formation page</a>.  Whether you are a backend person and code in Node/Ruby/Go or are a designer and only work with Illustrator, you are invited to participate.</p>
