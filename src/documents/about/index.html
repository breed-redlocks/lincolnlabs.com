        <h3>Lincoln Labs’ history<h3>

        <p>Out of the shellacking of 2012, we started LincolnLabs to reach a forgotten community that felt ostracized with no home. Though the media and the Beltway thought the technology community and Silicon Valley were solidly left, we thought differently. We were conservatarian living in Silicon Valley. If we are here, there has to be others!</p>

        <p>First, we started with small events in San Francisco and Silicon Valley. We were amazed at the response. Our first events spread like wildfire in the technology community. Hundreds of techies and young professionals came out of the woodwork to connect and build a community. A few weeks later, we were hosting events all around the country to replicate the growing community in Silicon Valley.</p>

        <p>In 2013, we reached thousands of people. We touched the east coast, west coast, and the midwest. In 2014, we are stepping up our game to reach more people and build a lasting community that will take action to solve America’s toughest problems through more efficient government, effective policies, and market-minded reforms.</p>
